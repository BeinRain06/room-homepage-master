## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Javascript

### What I learned

*calc(viewport - margin)*

i learn the usefulness of the **subproperty** `calc()`, when comes to align two differents main box perfectly(one on top , and the other to bottom) that the usual display is `grid` with css. This allow to resize the both box easily and to continue to play with the `margin` of their main container with simplicity. 

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

*sliders cards without external library*

Through the project we meet with interest to design a simple slider, a prototype that fit well for more than two cards to slide, quite using html, css and javascript. No external Library (as Jquery, swiper, ...) attached to the code for styling cards sliders because of a necessity to simplify the code source.

See our *Javascript* code under the `EventListener` of the function **slideToTheRightBoxLive()**



### Continued development

With times our need to realize soft transitions with between cards rather than showing it instantantly cary our interest to use library like **swipers** or **Jquery** just enough to delight users experience.
